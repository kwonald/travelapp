#Getting Started

git clone https://github.com/kwonald/travelapp.git

cd travelapp/Tumbleweed

npm install 

The above prepares the react-native application.
For testing, you must run the following files on localhost:3000 or a reachable website.


THEN, start your react-native app

react-native run-ios
